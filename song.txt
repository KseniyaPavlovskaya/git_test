Take me I'm alive
Never was a girl with a wicked mind
But everything looks better when the sun goes down
I had everything
Opportunities for eternity
And I could belong to the night
Then your eyes
Your eyes
I can see in your eyes
Your eyes
You make me wanna die
I'll never be good enough
You make me wanna die
And everything you love will burn up in the light
And every time I look inside your eyes
You make me wanna die
Taste me drink my soul
Show me all the things that I shouldn't know
When there's a blue moon on the rise
I had everything
Opportunities for eternity
And I could belong to the night
Then your eyes
Your eyes
I can see in your eyes
Your eyes
Everything in your eyes
Your eyes
